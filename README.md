### How to run the code:
If you use `npm`:
```
npm install
```
I used yarn for this project, so if you use `yarn`:
```
yarn install
```

To view the project:
```
npm run build && npm run start
```
For yarn:
```
yarn build && yarn start
```

You should be able to view the application on `localhost:3000`.
